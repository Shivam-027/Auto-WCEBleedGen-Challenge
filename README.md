# Auto-WCEBleedGen-Challenge
This repository contains the submission for the Auto-WCEBleedGen Challenge, where the goal was to develop a classification and detection model for Bleeding and Non-bleeding frames. In this README, we provide an overview of the project, the achieved evaluation metrics, and visualizations of the model's performance on validation and testing datasets.
